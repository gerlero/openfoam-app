## üçè Prerequisites

* An Apple silicon or Intel Mac
* A recent version of macOS
    * Apple silicon: macOS 14 Sonoma or later
    * Intel: macOS 13 Ventura or later
    * _Running an older version of macOS? [See here](#i-have-an-older-version-of-macos-and-cannot-upgrade-to-a-supported-version-what-can-i-do)_


## üì¶ Install

* ‚ú® Get the latest OpenFOAM version with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (recommended):

    ```sh
    brew install --no-quarantine gerlero/openfoam/openfoam
    ```

* Or, choose the OpenFOAM version(s) you want:

    * **OpenFOAM v2506**

        * Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

            ```sh
            brew install --no-quarantine gerlero/openfoam/openfoam@2506
            ```

        * Manual download: [‚¨áÔ∏è Apple silicon](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/releases/latest/download/openfoam2506-app-arm64.zip) | [‚¨áÔ∏è Intel](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/releases/latest/download/openfoam2506-app-x86_64.zip)

    * **OpenFOAM v2412**

        * Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

            ```sh
            brew install --no-quarantine gerlero/openfoam/openfoam@2412
            ```

        * Manual download: [‚¨áÔ∏è Apple silicon](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/releases/latest/download/openfoam2412-app-arm64.zip) | [‚¨áÔ∏è Intel](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/releases/latest/download/openfoam2412-app-x86_64.zip)

    * _Need an older version of OpenFOAM? [See here](#can-i-get-an-older-version-of-openfoam)_

## üßë‚Äçüíª Use

Just open the **OpenFOAM** app to start an OpenFOAM session in a new Terminal window.

<img src="images/screenshot.png" width="650">

That's it! When using OpenFOAM, a read-only volume will be loaded and visible in the Finder. The OpenFOAM installation lives inside this virtual disk. When you're not actively using OpenFOAM, it is safe to "eject" the volume from the Finder sidebar.

**üíª From the command line**: when installed with Homebrew, the app includes a terminal command that starts an OpenFOAM session:

```sh
openfoam
```

If you did not install with Homebrew, you can get the same by invoking the following command (replace the path and app name as needed):

```sh
/Applications/OpenFOAM-v2506.app/Contents/Resources/etc/openfoam
```


## üôã Q&A

<details><summary><b>I also need ParaView. How can I get it?</b></summary>

Get the native macOS version of ParaView from the [official site](https://www.paraview.org/download/) or [install it with Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/paraview) (prefer the latter if you'd like to use OpenFOAM's `paraFoam` command).
</details>

<details><summary><b>Why do I see a dialog that says the app "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"?</b></summary>

This message appears because the app is not notarized by Apple. You can [tell macOS to allow the app to run](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445#openanyway). You only need to do this for the first launch of the app.
   
If you're installing with Homebrew, the suggested ``--no-quarantine`` option does this for you on install.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I compile and install my own (or third-party) solvers?</b></summary>

Yes. Just a few things to keep in mind:

* The OpenFOAM installation itself is not user-writable. This is very much intentional (and is similar with how it works with packaged OpenFOAM on Linux). The right way to install additional solvers and libraries is to place the binaries in `$FOAM_USER_APPBIN` and `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN` respectively. See [here](https://github.com/gerlero/porousMicroTransport) for an example of a project that installs this way.

* The compiler used on macOS is Apple's Clang, which is not the same as the GCC compiler used by default on Linux. If your code was never tested with Clang before, some lines might require a little tweaking ([this is the most common fix that is needed](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/issues/87)) to be able to build across both compilers.

* The default macOS filesystem is case-insensitive, which differs from Linux. See the next question for what this means.

</details>

<details><summary><b>What's the deal with case sensitivity?</b></summary>

[OpenFOAM is notably developed with a case-sensitive filesystem in mind](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/issues/1602). This is a non-issue on Linux systems, which conventionally use case-sensitive filesystems. In practice, a case-sensitive filesystem means that two different files named `phi` and `Phi` in the same directory can exist just fine. In contrast, a case-_insensitive_ filesystem, as is the default on macOS, will only allow one of those files to exist in the same folder.

This project gets around potential case-sensitivity issues by putting OpenFOAM itself inside a (read-only) disk image with its own case-sensitive filesystem, which is mounted as a virtual volume during use. This is enough to accommodate OpenFOAM, and for most purposes you can just use your regular filesystem for everything else (e.g. to store OpenFOAM cases).

However, there are a few circumstances where this is not sufficient (e.g. solvers/cases using case-sensitive field names). If you fall under one of these, consider [creating a case-sensitive disk image with the macOS Disk Utility](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/disk-utility/dskutl11888/mac) for the case-sensitive stuff.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Why do I get a dialog prompting me to install the "command line developer tools"?</b></summary>

You are attempting something that requires development tools (e.g. a compiler), and you do not have such tools installed yet. Just follow the steps to install the necessary tools from Apple and you should be good to go.
</details>

<details><summary><b>I have an older version of macOS and cannot upgrade to a supported version. What can I do?</b></summary>

If you cannot upgrade to a newer macOS, you still have a few alternatives:

* **Try [installing the latest release](#-install) anyway.** The [required macOS versions](#-prerequisites) are those on which the latest release has been tested and is known to work. It is likely that the app will work too on some previous versions of macOS, but due to limited resources I cannot test with older OS versions

* Download an older release that was tested with your configuration:

</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I get an app for a version from the OpenFOAM Foundation ([openfoam.org](openfoam.org), e.g. OpenFOAM 13)?</b></summary>

No. The OpenFOAM Foundation's distribution [does not support native compilation on macOS](https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app/issues/14#issuecomment-1049843002).
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I uninstall the app?</b></summary>

If you installed with Homebrew, uninstall with ``brew uninstall``. If you downloaded manually, delete the app.
</details>

## üî® Building from source

If you need to, building an **OpenFOAM.app** entirely from source is as easy as running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gerlero/openfoam-app.git
cd openfoam-app
pixi run make
```

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) and the Xcode Command Line Tools are required. See the available configuration variables and alternative targets for `make` in the [`Makefile`](Makefile). Note that the compilation of OpenFOAM from source may take a while.
